The attack setup for SnailLoad. A victim downloads data from an attacker’s HTTP server while it watches a video on a video-sharing platform, e.g., YouTube. Due to the net- work bottleneck on the victim’s side, the attacker can infer the transmitted amount of data by measuring the packet round trip time. The round trip time traces are unique per video and can be used to classify the video watched by the victim.
