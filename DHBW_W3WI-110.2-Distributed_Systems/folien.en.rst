W3WI_110.2 - Distributed Systems 
================================================

----

:Lecturer: `Prof. Dr. Michael Eichberg <https://delors.github.io/cv/folien.de.rst.html>`__
:Contact: michael.eichberg@dhbw.de, Raum 149B
:Version: 1.0 (WWI23SCA)



Core Topics
---------------------------

.. class:: incremental-list 

- Terminology, concepts, architectures, requirements profiles and architecture models for distributed systems
- Design and implementation approaches
- Comparison of different middleware concepts
- Synchronous and asynchronous communication, remote method calls
- Asynchronous communication and messaging systems
- Security aspects in distributed systems



Previous Knowledge
---------------------------

.. class:: incremental-list

- Who is familiar with Java?
- Who is familiar with Python?
- Who is familiar with JavaScript/Typescript?
- Who has done any development outside of university projects?
- Who knows what a RESTful API is?



Examination - Portfolio
------------------------------------------

.. background:: 

    .. class:: list-with-explanations

    - the module has 55 lecture hours
    - Distributed Systems has 22 lecture hours
      
      â‡’ Distributed Systems will contribute up to **50** points to the final grade for the module. (Please, don't do the math.)

.. rubric:: 2 Parts

.. class:: dhbw

1. Presentations (10min per student) - max. 15 points
2. Programming Exercise (in teams of 5 students) - max. 35 points

.. attention::
  :class: incremental

  Students who present together should not be in the same team for the programming exercise.



Presentations - General Conditions
------------------------------------------

.. class:: list-with-explanations

- The presentations should deal in particular with the core content of the lecture and *be of a conceptual nature*.  

  This means that, after briefly presenting the overall purpose of the framework/technology/protocol, the architecture/the details must be presented. That is, how errors are dealt with, which services are offered, which guarantees/security aspects are implemented, how scalability is achieved, etc. 
  
  No promotional presentations!
- The presentations are to be uploaded to Moodle the evening before the agreed date.
- Presentations should be in English.
- The speakers should not rotate several times during the presentation. I.e. the first speaker presents first, then the second, and so on. This is necessary for the grading.



Presentations - Available Topics
------------------------------------------

.. presenter-note:: 

            Backend Subsetting and connection churn is about the challenges that arise when a backend service is split into multiple services and how the connection churn can be managed.
