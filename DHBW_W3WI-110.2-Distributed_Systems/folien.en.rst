Examination - Portfolio
------------------------------------------

.. background:: 

    .. class:: list-with-explanations

    - the module has 55 lecture hours
    - the lecture Distributed Systems has 22 lecture hours
      
      â‡’ Distributed Systems will contribute up to **50** points to the final grade for the module. (Please, don't do the math.)

.. rubric:: 2 Parts

.. class:: dhbw

1. Presentations - max. 15 points
2. Programming Exercise - max. 35 points

.. attention::
  :class: incremental

  Students who present together should not be in the same team for the programming exercise.



Presentations - General Conditions
------------------------------------------

.. class:: incremental-list list-with-explanations 

- The presentations should deal in particular with the core content of the lecture and *be of a conceptual nature*.  

  This means that, after briefly presenting the overall purpose of the framework/technology/protocol, the architecture/the details must be presented. That is, how errors are dealt with, which services are offered, which guarantees/security aspects are implemented, how scalability is achieved, etc. 
  
  No promotional presentations!
- Presentations should be in English.
- The speakers should not rotate several times during the presentation. I.e. the first speaker presents first, then the second, and so on. This is necessary for the grading.

.. attention::
  :class: incremental

  The presentations are to be uploaded to Moodle the evening before the agreed date.



Presentations - Available Topics
------------------------------------------

Will be announced in the next lecture!
